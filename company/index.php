<h2>About Shore Connection</h2>
<h3>Experienced Web Design, Hosting and Development Professionals</h3>
<p>Shore Connection is a small group of Internet design, networking, marketing and programming professionals who came together in 1997 to offer a complete set of services to our clients.  The need to offer professional and reliable, service oriented Internet skills was greater than ever.  Over the years, the industry has seen its ups and downs and more than a few web development companies have come and gone. Shore Connection continues to prosper.</p>
<p>In 1998 Shore Connection decided to move into managing its own series of destination guides for the greater Atlantic City area.  This new direction provided valuable insight into online marketing and search engine placement that we pass on to our clients to this day. Today we now manage guides for 1000's of cities around the world and our guides see almost 20,000 visitors a day.</p>
<p>With the growth in our company and services, it became apparent that Shore Connection needed a more reliable hosting solution for both our clients' and our own website needs.  In 2000, Shore Connection chose to move into the hosting businesses and chose one of the top hosting locations in the United States.  Our servers are state of the art and protected by multiple firewalls. To us, reliability and quality have been our focus.</p>
<p>A year later, many of our client's began approaching us to offer an online shopping cart solution so that they could market their products online.  After a great deal of trials and tribulations, Shore Connection settled on Miva Merchant and became a Miva Certified Business Partner.  The flexible yet generic shopping cart system provides the perfect balance of features, reliability and customization that we and our clients needed.  </p>
<p>Today Shore Connection focuses its efforts on providing a superior personal, professional and quality oriented relationship with all of our clients, all of which who's names we know. Contact us today to find out how our approach to the Internet and our clients is different than our competitors.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Jason S. Bailey<br />President, Webmaster and Designer</p>
